                                            A donation is a voluntary transfer of property (often money) from the transferor (donor)

                                              recipient (donee). (The recipient gives nothing in exchange for the donated property.)
                                            When a donor knowingly, intentionally, and unconditionally conveys property (or a symbol
                                             of the intended property) to a donee, the donation goes into effect and becomes irrevocable
                                              upon the donee's acceptance thereof.
